## A personal Genshin Impact info project

A front-end application for different infos regarding the RPG game, Genshin Impact, made while learning about ReactJS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) was used for styling.

The data were used from the [GENSHIN.DEV](https://github.com/genshindev/api) API

Some missing data like images are taken from [gensh.in](https://www.gensh.in/) and [genshin.honeyhunterworld](https://genshin.honeyhunterworld.com/?lang=EN)
